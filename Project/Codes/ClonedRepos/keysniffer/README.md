# keysniffer
A Linux kernel module to grab keys pressed in the keyboard, or a keylogger.

It's also an academic project for devs willing to learn Linux kernel module programming, with extensive comments, checkpatch.pl scanned code, standards-compliant Makefile and DKMS support.

keysniffer was initially written for the US keyboard (and conforming laptops). By default it shows human-readable strings for the keys pressed. Optionally, the `keycode shift_mask` pair can be printed in hex or decimal. You can lookup the keycodes in `/usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h`.

The keypress logs are recorded in debugfs as long as the module is loaded. Only root or sudoers can read the log. The module name has been camouflaged to blend-in with other kernel modules.

You can, however, execute a script at shutdown or reboot (the procedure would be distro-specific) to save the keys to a file.

**DISCLAIMER:** keysniffer is intended to track your own devices and NOT to trespass on others. The author has never used it to compromise any third-party device and is not responsible for any unethical application.

## Compilation
### Build
Clone the repository and run:

    # make
Note that you need to have the linux kernel headers installed for your running kernel version.

To insert the module into the kernel, run:

    # insmod kisni.ko
    OR
    # make load

To unload the module (and clear the logs), run:

    # rmmod kisni

### DKMS support
If you have DKMS installed, you can install keysniffer in such a way that it survives kernel upgrades. It is recommended to remove older versions of keysniffer by running `dkms remove -m kisni -v OLDVERSION --all` as root. To install the new version, run:

    # make -f Makefile.dkms

To uninstall it, run:

    # make -f Makefile.dkms uninstall

## Usage
To view the pressed keys, run:

```
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/kisni/keys
modinfo kisni.ko
cat /sys/kernel/debug/kisni/keys
#
```

To log generic hex keycodes in the format `keycode shift_mask`, run:

```
# insmod kisni.ko codes=1
// Type something
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/kisni/keys

To log the keycodes in decimal, run:

    # insmod kisni.ko codes=2

To check the module details:

```
# modinfo kisni.ko
