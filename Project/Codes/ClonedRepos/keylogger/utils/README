setup
----------------------------------------
     This is an executable bash script that builds, installs and removes a
command line-specified module.  It first executes "make clean" and "make" in
the current directory.  Then the script executes "sudo insmod" followed by
"sudo rmmod" using the user-supplied module name as a parameter.  Finally,
"make clean" is executed again to remove any generated files.  insrm is invoked
from the command line as follows:

               INSRM <module name>

     This script requires that your current working directory contain the
module's source code file, a *working* make file and the insrm script itself.
Note that only the module's name should be supplied as the argument.  THE
EXTENSION OF THE SOURCE CODE FILE SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED.  So, to build,
install and then remove a module whose source code file is named hello.c, you
would type the following at the command line: "insrm hello".

syscall.asm
----------------------------------------
     This is an assembly language program written for 32-bit linux systems, to
be assembled with nasm and linked with ld.  (The included make file should
handle all that for you.)  This program just makes a call to a hardcoded system
call (as specified by its syscall table index).  After the kernel call has been
made, the program exits.
