FILE.H
     Contains methods relating to file io in kernel-space: open, close, read
write.  See prototypes for a list of *working* methods.

keysym.h
--------
     Contains methods for translating key symbols into ASCII-encoded
characters.  There are a variety of functions, each specific to a particular
key symbol type, and a wrapper function that selects the appropriate
translation function.  To simplify the translation process, I've also written a
wrapper function that uses the type-specific translation functions to do the
translation.  Also, I make no guarantee that the type-specific functions will
without the wrapper, so just call the wrapper please.
