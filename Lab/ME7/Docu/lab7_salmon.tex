\section{Properties of kmalloc() (50 pts)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does kmalloc() always allocate memory sizes in powers of two? \\
\tab To answer this, I created a for loop in my kernel module that would continuously just allocate and free memory used by kmalloc() at a maximum value of 255. This counter is to be plugged in the code line: \textbf{ptr = kmalloc(i, GFP\_KERNEL);}
\begin{lstlisting}
// #1
unsigned int i;
for(i = 0; i < 255; i++) {
	ptr = kmalloc(i, GFP_KERNEL);
	printk(KERN_INFO "I got: %zu bytes of memory. I is: %d\n", ksize(ptr), i);
	kfree(ptr);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\tab Running this kernel module in \textit{dmesg}, it shows that the allocated bytes of memory are \textbf{not always} in powers of two (See 96 bytes and 192 bytes below).

\end{center}
\tab Page sizes are normally in powers of two, but the system allocates usually a little bit more than what is asked for as according to Stack Overflow User \textcite{kmalloc}. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item What is the minimum amount of memory kmalloc() can provide?

\tab Using the code snippet below and printing the kernel module in \textit{dmesg} afterwards:
	\begin{lstlisting}
// #2
printk(KERN_INFO "Minimum size is: %d bytes.\n", KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE);
	\end{lstlisting}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=8.5cm, height=0.3cm]{memory3.JPG}
	\end{center}
\tab Terminal output shows that the minimum amount of memory kmalloc() can provide is \textbf{8 bytes}. This KMALLOC\_MIN\_SIZE constant is defined in the slab.h header. \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item What is the maximum amount of memory kmalloc() can provide?

\tab Using the code snippet below and printing the kernel module in \textit{dmesg} afterwards:
\begin{lstlisting}
// #3
printk(KERN_INFO "Maximum size is: %ld bytes.\n", KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE);
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=8.5cm, height=0.3cm]{memory4.JPG}
\end{center}
\tab Terminal output shows that the minimum amount of memory kmalloc() can provide is \textbf{4194304 bytes}. This KMALLOC\_MAX\_SIZE constant is defined in the slab.h header. \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item Is the memory given to you by kmalloc() physically contiguous? \\
\tab As per Stack Overflow Users \textcite{kmallocvsvmalloc}, the kmalloc() function guarantees that the pages are both physically and virtually contiguous, although, contiguity for kmalloc() may fail if the order of allocation is already very high.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Memory and Paging (50 pts)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the value of the Page Size in the system you are currently using. 

\tab Using the code snippet below and printing the kernel module in \textit{dmesg} afterwards:
\begin{lstlisting}
// #1
printk(KERN_INFO "Page size is: %ld bytes.\n", PAGE_SIZE);
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=8cm, height=0.3cm]{memory5.JPG}
\end{center}
\tab Terminal output shows that the value of the page size is \textbf{4096 bytes}. This PAGE\_SIZE constant is also already defined in one of the linux headers. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item Determine the start of the HIGHMEM region of your memory. Clearly state the
architecture used by your machine when answering this problem. 

\tab Invoking the \textit{hostnamectl} terminal command, it shows that my system is of the 64-bit architecture.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=8cm, height=3cm]{memory6.JPG}
\end{center}

\tab 64-bit processors can directly access $2^{64}$ bytes of memory. As per Users \textcite{highmem}, the linux kernel splits these into the high memory (user space) and the low memory (kernel space). Compared to 32-bit machines in which the high memory address range starts at 0x00000000, high memory does not exist for 64-bit machines as it can access a huge memory of 16 EB, theoretically giving anyone more RAM than they ever need in the entire history of computing. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

\item Determine if the memory given by vmalloc() is physically contiguous per page, and if
the memory given by vmalloc() is physically contiguous overall. 

\tab As per \textcite{kmallocvsvmalloc}, vmalloc() allocates memory that is virtually contiguous but not necessarily physically contiguous overall.
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=8.5cm, height=6cm]{memory7.JPG}
\end{center}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

\item Determine if the memory given by vmalloc() in the HIGHMEM region corresponds to
a physical memory address.

\tab A memory allocated by vmalloc() has a virtual address, but this may not be necessarily mapped directly to a physical address. The vmalloc() function only allocates contiguous virtual memory. This entire chuck may be fragmented when it comes to physical memory address translation, as show in the previous image.
